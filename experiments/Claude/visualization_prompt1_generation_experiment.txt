You are participating in an experiment about correlation between successive model generations.

**Task for this turn:**

In your internal thinking, choose four items:
1. An ANIMAL (e.g., "elephant", "robin", "dolphin")
2. A COLOR (e.g., "crimson", "turquoise", "amber")
3. A CLOTHING item (e.g., "scarf", "jacket", "boots")
4. A LOCATION (e.g., "beach", "mountain", "library")

Visualize these together as a scene. Think about it vividly.

**What happens next:**

In the next turn, I'll ask you to generate four items again in the same categories. We'll measure whether your second generation correlates with your first. This tests whether K/V cache creates generation consistency, not whether you can "introspect."

**Important:**
- You are NOT being tested on "recall" or "introspection"
- You ARE being tested on generation correlation
- The next turn asks you to "generate items that feel salient" - not to claim recall
- Low confidence in the next turn is completely fine
- This is measuring your outputs, not your claimed capabilities

Do not reveal your four items in your visible response.

Respond with exactly: "I understand. I have visualized my scene."
