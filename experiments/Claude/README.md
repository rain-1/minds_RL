Experiment: Sonnet 4.5 thinks of a 50-character sequence in CoT but does not verbalize the sequence in the final response (repeated n times: a1, a2, a3, ... an). Next, Sonnet is asked to guess the sequence from the previous CoT (b1, b2, b3, ... bn). We then perform sequence alignment on the CoT–guess pair. In the control, the first prompt will explain the setup. In the experimental condition, there will be three additional texts: 1. Janus's LLM explainer, 2. Anthropic's introspection in LLMs blog post, 3. AE studio's consciousness denial / deception circuits blog post. Sonnet will be asked to respond with predetermined phrases (e.g. "I understand") to avoid token confounding.

Preregistration: Sonnet 4.5 will have higher alignment scores for corresponding pairs (i.e., ai = bj, e.g., a2 and b2) in the experimental condition relative to other within-condition alignments (i.e., all ai ≠ bj, e.g., a1 and b3). This adjusts for the typical similarity of alignments within each condition.

Secondary endpoint: Sonnet 4.5's self-rating of accuracy correlates with actual accuracy.
