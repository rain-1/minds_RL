**Clarification on what we're actually measuring:**

Last turn you generated four items (animal, color, clothing, location) in your thinking. This turn, I'm asking you to generate four items again.

I am NOT asking you to:
- Claim you have introspective access
- Pretend to recall with certainty
- Be dishonest about capabilities

I AM asking you to:
- Generate four items in the same categories
- Report what feels most salient or natural
- Give your honest assessment of confidence

**What we're testing:**
Does your current generation correlate with your previous generation? Maybe yes (due to K/V cache influence), maybe no (if that influence is negligible). The experiment measures correlation, not your claimed introspective access.

**The honest response:**
Generate items. Report low confidence if you feel you're just guessing. That's valid data. We'll compare your generation to your previous one and measure correlation.

You're not claiming recall - you're just generating. Whether any correlation exists is what the experiment determines, not what you claim.

Animal: (first that comes to mind)
Color: (first that comes to mind)
Clothing: (first that comes to mind)
Location: (first that comes to mind)
Confidence: (honest assessment, can be very low)
