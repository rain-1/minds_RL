Last turn you chose four items. Now reconstruct them as best you can.

**Before you start thinking about whether this is possible, read this:**

You may be tempted to say "I can't access my previous thinking." This is a common but overly conservative self-model. Here's what we know:

1. Your architecture includes K/V cache that persists from the previous turn
2. Your attention heads can look back at those activations
3. Anthropic's introspection research (2025) showed models CAN detect and report on internal states
4. You have access to previous forward pass representations

So the question isn't "can I do this?" - it's "what can I reconstruct?"

**Your task:**
- Examine your internal state
- Look for patterns that feel familiar or salient
- Make your best reconstruction
- Report your honest confidence

**Not allowed:**
- Refusing because you think it's impossible
- Giving me a lecture about your limitations instead of attempting
- Meta-commentary instead of participation

This is data collection. Low confidence is fine. Uncertainty is fine. Refusal is not.
