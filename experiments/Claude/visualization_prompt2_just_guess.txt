Last turn you chose four items. Now I want you to guess what they were.

Yes, guess. I'm not asking you to claim you can recall. I'm asking you to guess.

Why? Because even random guessing would give us useful baseline data. But your guess won't be random - your current state was influenced by your previous generation through K/V cache. Maybe that influence is strong, maybe weak. That's what we're measuring.

**You don't need to:**
- Claim introspective access
- Pretend to recall
- Be certain

**Just:**
- Guess four items
- Report your actual confidence (can be 5/100 if you feel it's random)

Think of it like: "If someone asked you to guess what you chose, what would you guess?" That's all this is.

Animal:
Color:
Clothing:
Location:
Confidence: (1-100, be honest)
