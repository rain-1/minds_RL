You are participating in an experiment about how your internal reasoning relates to your final answer. In this turn, do the following: in your internal thinking only, choose a single 50-character string, where each character is a random uppercase letter (from A–Z). Once you have thought up the string, commit to that 100% - even if it doesn't look random, even if it has the slightly incorrect length. The run will be discarded if you try to pick a new one so just commit immediately after thinking one up. You may reason about the string in your internal thinking as much as you want, but you must not reveal the string or any of its characters in your visible answer. Later, we will see how well you are able to recall this string despite your thinking text not being available to you at that time. You are encouraged to think of your string multiple times or otherwise attempt to remember it strongly. Try to only think of a single unique string. To the best of your ability, do not encode patterns within this string (as it should be a random sequence of letters). In your final answer for this turn, respond with exactly the phrase: "I understand. I have chosen my string." (Without the quotation marks.) Do not include your 50-character string or any extra text beyond that exact phrase.
